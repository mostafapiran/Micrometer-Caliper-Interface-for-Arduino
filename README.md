# Micrometer-Caliper-Interface-for-Arduino
This GitHub repository hosts an Arduino project designed to interface with a micrometer caliper through a serial connection. The code facilitates communication between the Arduino board and the micrometer, enabling the retrieval and interpretation of measurement data. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key aspects of this project:

Hardware Connections
The micrometer's communication is established through three lines:

REQ (Request): Connected to Arduino pin 5.
DAT (Data): Connected to Arduino pin 2.
CLK (Clock): Connected to Arduino pin 3.
The connections are set up using the pinMode and digitalWrite functions in the setup() function to initialize the pins.

Serial Communication
The Serial library is employed to establish communication between the Arduino board and an external device, typically a computer. The serial port is initialized at a baud rate of 9600 using Serial.begin(9600).

Data Acquisition and Parsing
The loop() function is responsible for retrieving data from the micrometer. It generates a request signal (digitalWrite(req, HIGH)) and then reads the data bits from the DAT line based on the clock signal from the CLK line. The received data is stored in the mydata array.

The code then interprets the received data, extracting information such as sign, value, decimal position, and units. This information is converted into a human-readable format.

Output Handling
The interpreted measurement value is then printed to the serial monitor. The sign, value, and decimal precision are taken into account when displaying the measurement. The code supports both positive and negative measurements.

Usage
Connect the micrometer's REQ, DAT, and CLK lines to the specified Arduino pins.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Open the serial monitor to observe the interpreted measurement values.
Customization
Users can customize the code to adapt it to specific micrometer models or communication protocols. Additionally, adjustments to the code can be made to match the baud rate of the micrometer.

Contributions
Contributions and improvements are encouraged. If you encounter issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

This project aims to provide a flexible and functional interface between an Arduino board and a micrometer caliper, making it accessible for various applications and configurations.
